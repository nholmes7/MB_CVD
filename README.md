# MB_CVD
This is where all the code will live for the tube furnace CVD system in SEB 2032.\

The files do the following:
* main.py: the main file for the project
* CVD.ui: the XML file which contains all the information for the GUI
* gui.py: the result of compiling the CVD.ui file with pyuic5
* example_recipe: demonstrates the formatting required for the CVD recipes
