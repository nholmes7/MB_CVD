A description of the files follows:

* gui.py: the result of compiling the CVD.ui file with pyuic5
* example_recipe: demonstrates the formatting required for the CVD recipe
* equipment.py: defines classes for the different types of equipment used in the system with methods for controlling them
* recipe.py: recipe class for handling recipes
* startup.py: function which is called on program startup in order to establish communication with all networked devices
